## Notebooks
* `full_pipeline.ipynb`: This notebook takes you through the entire pipeline: data ingestion, calculating dataset similarity, and visualizing the search results with the DatasetsSummarizer. This notebook will show you our results and walk you through the metadata pre-processing and similarity calculations in more detail. You can also use this notebook to change the search keyword and produce new results.
* `start_from_metadata.ipynb`: This notebook takes you through the similarity calculations, starting from a metadata dataframe that has already been created. This notebook will show you our results, and walk you through the similarity calculations in more detail.
* `DatasetsSummarizer_Tool_Demo.ipynb`: This notebook uses the DatasetsSummarizer library to create the summarizer visualization using pre-generated metadata.

## DatasetsSummarizer

Datasets Summarizer is compatible with Jupyter Notebooks. Need the x and y values based on any similarity metric to generated the similarity plot between datasets. Supports the metadata format generated by [datamart-profiler](https://docs.auctus.vida-nyu.org/python/datamart-profiler.html#) library to generate the Detail View to explore each dataset.

Note that we used another GitHub repo (https://github.com/soniacq/DatasetsVis) to manage our DatasetsSummarizer tool versioning and dependencies.

### Demo

Live demo (Google Colab):
- [Dataset results for Taxi query](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11NT0qudr2di9NXlR-DxZa0buzGreOqxs?usp=sharing)

In Jupyter Notebook (find this demo [here](https://github.com/egm68/dataset-visualization/blob/main/DatasetsSummarizer_Tool_Demo.ipynb)):
```Python
import DatasetsSummarizer
data = DatasetsSummarizer.get_taxi_data()
DatasetsSummarizer.plot_datasets_summary(data)
```

### Install

#### install via pip:
~~~~
pip install datasets-summarizer
~~~~

## Reproducing
Figures 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as referenced in our paper can be reproduced and interacted with using the `DatasetsSummarizer_Tool_Demo.ipynb` notebook. This demo notebook uses the same metadata that we used to produce the figures in the paper. Using one of the other two notebooks could result in slight variations in results if any of the datasets have changed or been updated since our results were produced.
